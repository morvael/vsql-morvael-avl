# vql-morvael-avl

Module specific classes for ["A Victory Lost"](https://vassalengine.org/wiki/Module:A_Victory_Lost).

Resurrected from revision 5382 of old [SVN repository](https://svn.code.sf.net/p/vassalengine/svn/VSQL-src/branches/morvael),
that contained code for version 4.4.4 with extra fix added from later
revisions (9150 and 9151) that possibly went into version 4.4.5 (source lost,
but decompiled code from both versions was compared).

Remade into Maven project on GitHub in order to save the code for future
generations and make the module compatible with Vassal 3.6+.
